### 
**[:bell: News! :bell: ]
We have released a new survey paper:"[Generative Knowledge Graph Construction: A Review](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.12714.pdf)" based on this repository, with a perspective of existing Generative Knowledge Graph Construction! We are looking forward to any comments or discussions on this topic :)** 

## üïµÔ∏è Introduction
Generative Knowledge Graph Construction (KGC) refers to those methods that leverage the sequence-to-sequence framework for building knowledge graphs, which is flexible and can be adapted to widespread tasks.
In this study, we summarize the recent compelling progress in generative knowledge graph construction. 
We present the advantages and weaknesses of each paradigm in terms of different generation targets and provide theoretical insight and empirical analysis. 
Based on the review, we suggest promising research directions for the future. Our contributions are threefold: (1) We present a detailed, complete taxonomy for the generative KGC methods; 
(2) We provide a theoretical and empirical analysis of the generative KGC methods; 
(3) We propose several research directions that can be developed in the future.

## ‚öìÔ∏è Preliminary on Knowledge Graph Construction

Knowledge Graph Construction mainly aims to extract structural information from unstructured texts, 
such as Named Entity Recognition (NER), Relation Extraction (RE), Event Extraction (EE), Entity Linking (EL), and Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC).

Generally, KGC can be regarded as structure prediction tasks, where a model is trained to approximate a target function $F(x) \rightarrow y$, where $x \in \mathcal{X}$ denotes the input data and $y \in \mathcal{Y}$ denotes the output structure sequence. 
For instance, given a sentence, *"Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak co-founded Apple in 1977."*: 

- Named Entity Recognition aims to identify the types of entities, i.e., *‚ÄòSteve Job'*, *‚ÄòSteve Wozniak'* $\Rightarrow$ *PERSON*, *‚ÄòApple'* $\Rightarrow$ *ORG*; 

- Relation Extraction aims to identify the relationship of the given entity pair $\langle$*Steve Job*, *Apple*$\rangle$ as *founder*;

- Event Extraction aims to identify the event type as *Business Start-Org* where *‚Äòco-founded'* triggers the event and (*Steve Jobs*, *Steve Wozniak*) are participants in the event as *AGENT* and *Apple* as *ORG* respectively. 

- Entity Linking aims to link the mention *Steve Job* to *Steven Jobs (Q19837)* on Wikidata, and *Apple* to *Apple (Q312)* as well.

- Knowledge Graph Completion aims to complete incomplete triples $\langle$*Steve Job*, *create*,  *?*$\rangle$ for blank entities *Apple*, *NeXT Inc.* and *Pixar*.

### 1. Copy-based Sequence.
This paradigm refers to developing more robust models to copy the corresponding entity directly from the input sentence during the generation process. 
As shown in figure, the model copies the head entity from the input sentence and then the tail entity.

As shown in figure, the output is a linearization of the extracted knowledge structure.

### 3. Label-based Sequence.
This paradigm refers to utilizing the extra markers to indicate specific entities or relationships.
As shown in figure, the output sequence copies all words in the input sentence, as it helps to reduce ambiguity.
In addition, this paradigm uses square brackets or other identifiers to specify the tagging sequence for the entity of interest. 
The relevant labels are separated by the separator "$|$" within enclosed brackets. 
Meanwhile, the labeled words are described with natural words so that the potential knowledge of the pre-trained model can be leveraged.

    - [[Paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.14698)


### 4. Indice-based Sequence.
This paradigm generates the indices of the words in the input text of interest directly, and encodes class labels as label indices.
As the output is strictly restricted, it will not generate indices that corresponding entities do not exist in the input text, except for relation labels.

### 5. Blank-based Sequence.
This paradigm refers to utilizing templates to define the appropriate order and relationship for the generated spans.
As shown in figure,  the template refers to a text describing an event type, which adds blank argument role placeholders.
The output sequences are sentences where the blank placeholders are replaced by specific event arguments.
